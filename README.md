üìä Customer Churn Prediction

A Python project that predicts customer churn using Logistic Regression and generates an interactive HTML report with visualizations, metrics, and dataset insights.

üöÄ Features

Loads CSV automatically from the data/ folder (or specify a file)

Preprocessing:

Handles missing values

Encodes categorical variables

Converts Churn (Yes/No ‚Üí 1/0)

Model:

Logistic Regression (scikit-learn)

Train/test split (80/20)

Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix

Analysis:

Top 10 most important features (by model coefficients)
